## Why is this program called "Acarine"?

Acarine is a type of mite that buries itself into bees, eventually killing them. I felt the name worked well because for the Buffer Overflow development process as you're slowly burying yourself deeper into the target program and you're exploiting it for all the nutrients you need (information) until you kill it and get your shell. 

The idea also came from the name of a song which describes the same; "buried deep, inside of me, Acarine" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xePP-tpwbQ). 

Basically, as acarines are parasitic they also go hand-in-hand with the concept of an offensive exploit that does that same.
